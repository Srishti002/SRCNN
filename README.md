# SRCNN
## Project Description
This project is about implementing SRCNN(Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) on low resolution images to obtain high resolution images. There are four different approaches to super resolution in general. These are:-
> 1. Patch based ( or example based):- This method work by using a database of low and high-resolution image patches to learn the mapping between them.
> 2. Edge based:- These focus on preserving and enhancing edge information in the image during the super-resolution process.
> 3. Image statistical methods:- These methods use statistical properties of images to guide the super-resolution process.
> 4. Prediction models:- This includes CNNs based methods like SRCNN.

So, in this project we are implementing **prediction models methods like SRCNN** for transforming low resolution image into high resolution image.
